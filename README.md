XBox Debug Monitor for XBox 360

it might be manager idfk i dont have the code to check what it really stands for

it might be really really broken right now but i dont have the resources to test and fix
either way, my favorite project, do what you will with it

don't expect me to do any more work on this, as i said above i dont have the resources to even try
